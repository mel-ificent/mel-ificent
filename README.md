### Hi there, I'm Melissa 👋

For the better part of the last 10 years, I have been working as a tech consultant configuring enterprise applications to help businesses run better.  Recently, I decided that I wanted to go back to my roots and dive into coding.  I'm currently enrolled in a Full-stack development course with the Georgia Institute of Technology to learn as much as I can about 'all things web development'.  My hope is that through this new journey I will gain the tools and experience needed to finally bring to life my ideas in the form of useful and beautiful applications.

I am constantly looking to learn more and find ways to contribute to the community.  In particular, I'm interested in collaborations that focus on community service or the general betterment of our world.  Feel free to reach out if you're looking for support on your next humanitarian project.


## A little more about me...
> 🐶 When I'm not behind a computer, I'm probably spoiling my two golden retrievers
> 🎨 I love to paint when I can and try to incorporate my work into my applications
> 🧚 My handle is a nickname my family used to jokingly tease me with when I was "up to no good" as a kid (yes it is a reference to Disney's villainess Maleficent), it still makes me chuckle after all these years
